reads and displays amazon.de cyber monday deals

# How to use
You need a head.html in your working dir. This is used to create the header of the result html file.
The program is executed with 1 paramerter, the output file location.

Example could be found in launch.sh (used on my own server in a */10 minute Cronjob).
